# Research: File Watching and Event Patterns

## Overview

Research Bun's file watching capabilities and determine the best approach for deferred/lazy file watching that only activates when consumers register event handlers.

## Deliverables

- [ ] Document Bun file watching options
- [ ] Document deferred activation pattern
- [ ] Recommend approach for event emitter pattern
- [ ] Identify potential edge cases

## Tasks

- [task-9f885cf7-research-bun-watchers.md](./task-9f885cf7-research-bun-watchers.md)
- [task-71cc916a-research-event-patterns.md](./task-71cc916a-research-event-patterns.md)

## Dependencies

None - this is the first phase.

## Next Steps

After research, proceed to Design Phase to define the API surface.
